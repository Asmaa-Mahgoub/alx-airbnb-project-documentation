# 📖 Airbnb Clone — User Stories Documentation

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this task was to **convert the use cases from the Use Case Diagram** into **clear and concise user stories**.  
These stories describe how different users (Guest, Host, Admin) interact with the Airbnb Clone system and what goals they aim to achieve.

## 🧩 What Was Done
Based on the **Use Case Diagram** from Task 1, I created a set of **user stories** that reflect the main functionalities of the Airbnb Clone backend system.  

Each story follows the **standard user story format**:
> “As a [type of user], I want to [perform an action] so that I can [achieve a goal].”

This approach ensures that system requirements are written from the user’s perspective and help guide the design and development process.

## 🧍‍♀️ Actors Identified
The following main actors were considered while writing the user stories:

- **Guest:** Searches for properties, makes bookings, processes payments, and leaves reviews.  
- **Host:** Lists properties, manages availability, accepts or declines bookings, and communicates with guests.  
- **Admin:** Monitors activity, manages users and listings, and ensures compliance with system policies.

## 🧾 User Stories Created
The following user stories were documented in the `user-stories.md` file:
