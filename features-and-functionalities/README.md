## 🔑 Core Functionalities

### 1. 👤 User Management
- Register and log in using secure authentication (JWT).
- Support roles: **guest**, **host**, and **admin**.
- Manage profiles, profile pictures, and account details.
- Integrate optional OAuth login (Google, Facebook).

### 2. 🏠 Property Management
- Hosts can create, update, and delete listings.
- Each listing includes: title, description, price, location, amenities, and availability.
- Property images stored using file storage or cloud services (e.g., AWS S3).

### 3. 🔍 Search and Filtering
- Search properties by location, price, guests, and amenities.
- Implement pagination for large datasets.

### 4. 📅 Booking Management
- Guests can book properties for specific dates.
- Prevent overlapping bookings using date validation.
- Allow cancellations and booking status updates (`pending`, `confirmed`, `canceled`, `completed`).

### 5. 💳 Payment Integration
- Process secure payments via **Stripe** or **PayPal**.
- Support multiple currencies.
- Trigger automatic payouts to hosts after successful stays.

### 6. 🌟 Reviews and Ratings
- Guests can leave reviews after completed bookings.
- Hosts can respond to feedback.
- Link reviews directly to bookings to prevent spam.

### 7. 🔔 Notification System
- Email and in-app notifications for:
  - Booking confirmations
  - Cancellations
  - Payment updates

### 8. 🛠️ Admin Dashboard

## 🚀 Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Scalability
- Use modular microservices for each module (user, property, booking).
- Enable load balancing and horizontal scaling.

### 2. Security
- Encrypt sensitive data (passwords, payments).
- Enforce HTTPS, rate limiting, and strong authentication.

### 3. Performance
- Use caching (Redis) for faster property searches.
- Optimize SQL queries for high-traffic endpoints.

### 4. Reliability & Testing
- Include unit, integration, and API endpoint tests.
- Ensure 99.9% uptime for booking and payment services.
